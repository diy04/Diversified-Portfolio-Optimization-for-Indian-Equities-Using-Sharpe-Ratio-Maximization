# Diversified-Portfolio-Optimization-for-Indian-Equities-Using-Sharpe-Ratio-Maximization
This project develops a portfolio optimization framework for the Indian equity market, selecting 25 stocks across five sectors and market caps to ensure diversification. It filters high-volatility portfolios and uses SLSQP to maximize Sharpe ratio within risk and budget limits. Backtested (2020â€“2025), it offers a Flask-based user tool.
